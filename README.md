# jQuery_JSON_quiz
Have a different method to calculate the score of a quiz.

================= ORIGINAL =========================
NOTE: NO LONGER MAINTAINED. PLEASE SEE Bobby Black's Fork FOR UPDATED VERSION

A simple quiz template written in js/jquery and is responsively designed.

In the future, I will add a generator to add questions, etc.

To use, open the file in a plain text editor such as TextMate (Mac) or Notepad++ (PC) or any other text editor and edit the data at the top of the document.

Use the quiz.html or to save space, you can use the minified version which compresses the non-editable code.

=======================================================

I changed a litle bit the code to have a different method to calculate the score. It's not based on a average score, it's by type. Example : we have : ( 1 - 2 - 3 - 4) If the user 3 ( 4 ), the script will show a div associated to the 4.
